# Flask Ready-to-Start Framework

This Git repository contains a Flask-based Ready-to-Start Framework, designed to provide a solid foundation for developing web applications using Flask and various rendering technologies. The repository consists of three main folders, each catering to different aspects of web development using flask. Below is an overview of each folder:

## 1. api_and_html_css_jquery_rendering

This folder contains code related to building web applications that render HTML, CSS, and use jQuery for client-side interactions. It serves as an introductory approach to building web interfaces with Flask while utilizing traditional web technologies for rendering.

## 2. api_and_react_rendering

In this folder, you'll find code that demonstrates integrating React with Flask to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. This approach leverages the power of React components to build modern, single-page applications that communicate with the Flask backend through APIs.

## 3. only_api_development

The `only_api_development` folder focuses solely on backend development with Flask. It provides a solid foundation for creating APIs and backend services that can be used by frontend applications built using various technologies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Flask Ready-to-Start Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the folder that corresponds to your preferred development approach (i.e., `api_and_html_css_jquery_rendering`, `api_and_react_rendering`, or `only_api_development`).

3. Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:5000/`.

Feel free to explore and modify the code in the respective folders to suit your project requirements.
